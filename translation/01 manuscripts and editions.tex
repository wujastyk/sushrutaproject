\section{The manuscripts and editions used in the vulgate editions by 
    Yādavaśarman Trivikrama Ācārya}

Yādavaśarman Trivikrama Ācārya produced three successive editions of the
\SS\ with the commentary of Ḍalhaṇa, in 1915, 1931 and 1938.  These
editions, especially the last, are generally considered the most scholarly
and reliable editions of the work, and have been constantly reprinted up
to the present day.\footnote{See also the study of these editions by \textcites[\S 
1.2]{kleb-2021b}[143--144]{wuja-2013}.}

The 1915 edition was based on three manuscripts.  The 1931 edition used another
seven plust two printed editions.  For his final 1938 edition, Ācārya used a
further three manuscripts.\footnote{The following account of the sources is
paraphrased from \citeauthor{susr-trikamji3}'s own account of his sources
\citep[22]{susr-trikamji3}.}  These sources are described as follow, with an
overview in Table~\ref{dw:tableofeds}.

\subsection{The sources of the 1915 edition}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[1] Calcutta, Royal Asiatic Society.  Covers the \emph{sūtra, nidāna, śārīra and 
        kalpa sthāna}s.  
    
    \item [2] Jaipur, Pandit Gaṅgādharabhaṭṭaśarman, lecturer at the Royal 
    Sanskrit University.  Covers the \emph{cikitsāsthāna} and the \emph{uttaratantra}.
    
    \item [3]  Bundi, my great friend the royal physician Paṃ.\ Śrīprasādaśarman  
    Covers the \emph{uttaratantra}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The sources of the 1931 edition}

\begin{enumerate}
    
    \item[1] Vārāṇasī, professor of literature, the great Gaurīnāthapāṭhaka.  With the 
    \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha}. Covers the \emph{nidānasthāna} and \emph{uttaratantra}.
    
    \item [2]  Ahmedabad.  My friend Sva.\ Vā.\ Vaidya Raṇachoḍalāla Motīlālaśarman.  
    With the \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha}.  Covers the \emph{śārīrasthāna}.
    
    \item [3] From the personal library of my great friend Sva.\ Vā.\ Vaidya
    Murārajīśarman. Extremely old. No commentary.  Covers the \emph{śārīrasthāna}.
    
    \item [4]  Puṇe, BORI library.  With the \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha}. Covers the
    \emph{śārīrasthāna}.\footnote{Not one of the three MSS of the
    \emph{śārīrasthāna} described in \cite{shar-vaid}.}
    
    \item [5]  Puṇe, BORI library.  With the \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha}. Complete.  
    With some damaged folia.
    
    \item [6]  Bombay, Asiatic Society.  Incomplete.\footnote{Possibly \MScite{Mumbai, 
    AS B.I.3} or \MScite{Mumbai, AS B.D.109} \citep[v.\,1, \# 212 and 
    213]{vela-1930}.  But both these have the \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha}.  The first 
    covers only the \emph{śārīrasthāna}; the second may be complete, but Velankar calls it 
    only “disorderly.”}
    
    \item [7] Varanasi, the private library of Vaidya Tryambakaśāstrī.  Covers the 
    \emph{cikitsāsthāna}.  The variant readings of this MS were compiled by Prof.\ 
    %    Guruprasādaśāstrī and supplied to Ācārya.
    
    \item [8]  A printed edition together with the commentary 
    \emph{Suśrutasandīpanabhāṣya} by Professor Hārāṇacandra Cakravārtti. Complete work.

    \item [9] A printed edition of the first 43 chapters of the
    \emph{sūtrasthāna}, printed in Bengali script, with the commentaries
    \emph{Bhānumatī}, \emph{Nibandhasaṅgraha}, edited by Vijayaratnasena and
    Niśikāntasena. This is the 1886 Calcutta edition numbered “g” by \citet[IB,
    311]{meul-hist}.\footcite{sena-1886}
    
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{The sources of the 1938 edition}
% \coffeestainC{1}{1}{180}{0}{-5 mm}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [1]  Gwalior, from the library of my great friend Paṃ.\ Rāmeśvaraśāstrin Śukla. 
    Covers the \emph{sūtra, nidāna, śārīra, cikitsā and kalpasthāna}s.
    
    \item[2] Bikaner, from the library of the Royal Palace, supplied by Paṃ.\ 
    Candraśekharaśāstrin. Contains the commentary 
    \emph{Nyāyacandrikāpañjikāvyākhyā} by Gayadāsa.  Covers the 
    \emph{nidānasthāna}.  This is almost certainly \MScite{Bikaner Anup 
        4390}.\footnote{See Dominik Wujastyk, “MS Bīkāner AnupLib 4390.” \emph{Pandit}. 
    <\url{http://panditproject.org/entity/108068/manuscript}>.}
    
    \item [3] Kathmandu, located in the private library of the Royal Guru Hemarāja 
    Śarman.  An extremely old palm-leaf manuscript. Readings from this MS were 
    compiled by Paṃ Nityānandaśarman Jośī and sent to Ācārya. Covers from the 
    beginning of the work to the end of the ninth chapter of the \emph{cikitsāsthāna}.  The 
    siglum for this manuscript in footnotes was \dev{tā} for \dev{tālapatrapustake}.

\subsection{Evaluation}

Estimates show that there are approximately 230 extant manuscript
witnesses for the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā}.\footnote{This figure is arrived
at by summing the MSS mentioned in \cite{ncc} and in the \cite{ngmcp}. The
real figure could be many scores higher.}  Many of these manuscripts cover only
one or more or its chapters.  Nevertheless, this is an order of magnitude
more evidence than was considered by Ācārya for his vulgate editions.

While the descriptions provided by Ācārya of his source materials seems at first
to be moderately comprehensive, Table~\ref{dw:tableofeds} reveals the real paucity
of textual basis for these editions.  Apparently, fifteen manuscripts were
consulted.  However, we quickly find that two of the sources were other people's
printed editions, and one of those covered less than a quarter of the work.  That
reduces the manuscript base to 13 manuscripts.   Ācārya does not appear to have
seen two of the manuscripts at all, having been sent collations prepared for him
by others (7 of 1931 and 3 of 1938).  Thus, Ācārya's final edition was based on
the personal consultation of eleven manuscripts.   One of them, no.\,6 of 1931,
remains mysterious. Only a single manuscript covers the whole of the
\emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā}, no.\,5 of the 1931 edition.  Manuscript 1 of 1938 is the
next most complete, but it omits the \emph{uttaratantra}, which comprises a third
of the work.  Manuscript 1 of the 1915 edition is next, but it still omits both of
the longest chapters, and thus offers less than half the work.  For the rest, the
evidence is spotty, with each part of the work being supported by only between
four and eight manuscripts, excluding the printed editions.

Two sources stand out for their historical importance.  The first is no.\,3 of
1931, which Ācārya calls “extremely old.”  It covered the \emph{śārīrasthāna}
only, and unfortunately we know nothing of the later history of this manuscript.
The second is no.\,3 of 1938, which is one of the important Nepalese manuscripts
being considered in the present project. Ācārya's remarks and references to
Hemarājaśarman's introduction to the \emph{Kāśyapasaṃhitā} allow us
to identify this manuscript as \MScite{Kathmandu NAK 
    5-333}.\footnote{\cites[22]{susr-trikamji3}[56--57]{hema-1938}. Discussed by
\citet[\S 1.1, 2.3]{kleb-2021b}.  See also \cites[IIB, 
25--41]{meul-hist}[161--169]{wuja-2003}.} But 
that manuscript covers the whole work, not
just up to the ninth chapter of the \emph{cikitsāsthāna} as
\citeauthor{susr-trikamji3} stated.\footcite[22]{susr-trikamji3}  Perhaps the editors
only received collations for this portion of the manuscript and did not know that it
was a witness for the whole work.

\subsection{The 1939 edition}        

In 1939, Yādavaśarman Trivikrama Ācārya and Nandakiśora Śarman co-edited an
edition of the \emph{sūtrasthāna} of the \emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} that was published
by the Swami Laxmi Ram ayurvedic centre in Jaipur, and printed at the famous
Nirṇayasāgara Press in Mumbai.\footnote{\cite{acar-1939}.  The description of the sources 
below is based on Yādavaśarman T. Ācārya's  remarks in his introduction 
(pp.\,3--4).. See also the remarks on this edition by
\citet[7]{kleb-2021a}.  On the Swami Laxmi Ram
centre, see \cite{hofe-2007}} The text was edited on the basis of the following sources.

\subsubsection{For the Bhānumatī}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A printed edition.  Covered the \emph{Bhānumatī} up to chapter Su.sū.40.
    The siglum was \dev{mu} for \emph{mudrita}.\footnote{\cite{sena-1893}.  The
    manuscript on which this edition was based is probably in the library of the
    Calcutta Sanskrit College, and described in \cite[v.\,X.1]{sast-1917}, which
    is not available to me.  See also \cite[IB, 495, n.\,57]{meul-hist} for
    mention of this manuscript.  The reference at \cite[217]{rao-sans} to CSCL
    accession number 97 in Bengali script may be this manuscript.}
    
    \item A manuscript in the India Office Library library provided through the
    Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune.\footnote{At this time,
    manuscripts from Britain were routinely lent to scholars in India and vice
    versa.} This manuscript covered the \emph{Bhānumatī} b up to the end of the
    \emph{sūtrasthāna}.  The siglum was \dev{ha} for
    \dev{hastalikhita}.\footnote{\MScite{London BL H. T. Colebrooke 908}

\subsubsection{For the Suśrutasaṃhitā}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A palm leaf manuscript from Hemarājaśarman's personal
    library.\footnote{I.e., \MScite{Kathmandu NAK 5-333}.}  The siglum was
    \dev{tā} for \dev{tāḍapatra}.
    
    \item His own published edition. The siglum was \dev{ḍa} for \dev{ḍalhaṇasaṃmataḥ
        pāṭhaḥ}.\footnote{\cite{susr-trikamji3}.  It is noteworthy that Ācārya refers to
    his 1938 edition as representing “the Ḍalhaṇa recension.”}
    
    \item Hārāṇacandra Cakravarti's published edition with his own
    commentary.\footcite{bhat-1917} The siglum was \dev{hā}.

\subsection{Evaluation}

The main innovation of this publication was to present the only surviving part of
the commentary on the \SS\ by the great eleventh-century medical scholar
Cakrapāṇidatta, namely the \emph{Bhānumatī}.\footcite[IA, 374--375 and IB,
495--496]{meul-hist} A secondary purpose was to present the text of the
\emph{sūtrasthāna} as read in \MScite{Kathmandu NAK 5-333}, that had recently been
brought to the editors' attention. In their judgement, the Kathmandu manuscript
presented a text that was closer to what Cakrapāṇidatta had before him than the
text according to Ḍalhaṇa.   This was the first \SS\ edition in which Ācārya used
sigla to identify the sources from which variant readings were reported, so while
it has limitations, it for the first time enables us to get some idea of origins
of the text (see Figure~\ref{fig:bhanumati-page-11}).

Ācārya noted in his introduction that the manuscripts containing the Ḍalhaṇa's
commentary all came together with the root-text of the \SS, and thus the main \SS\
text reflected the readings chosen by Ḍalhaṇa.  But the manuscripts of the
\emph{Bhānumatī} contained the commentary alone, without the root-text, and had
many explanations based on different readings of the root-text than those of
Ḍalhaṇa.  In many of these cases it was hard to know what the text that
Cakrapāṇidatta had before him. But Ācārya noted that Cakrapāṇidatta had a text
before him that had much in common with the text of the Nepalese
manuscript.\footnote{\cite[3--4]{acar-1939}.  See discussion by
\citet[7]{kleb-2021a}.}  

There is compelling evidence that Cakrapāṇidattas's \emph{Bhānumatī} commentary
once covered the whole text of the \SS.\footcite[IA, 375]{meul-hist}  The loss of
the rest of the work ranks amongst the greatest disasters in Āyurvedic
literature.  Remarkably, the whole \emph{Bhānumatī} may still have existed in the
early twentieth century. In 1903, Palmyr Cordier reported being privately informed
of a complete copy of the work in a personal manuscript collection in
Benares.\footcite[332]{cord-1903}
