The REALSCRIPTS package
=======================

Small package to replace `\textsuperscript` & `\textsubscript`
by equivalent commands that use OpenType font features
to access the appropriate glyphs if possible.

Provides `\textsubsuperscript` (and `\textsupersubscript`) for
setting subscripts and superscripts on top of each other.

Also patches LaTeX's default footnote command to use this
new `\textsuperscript` for footnote symbols.

Requires fontspec running on either XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.

For more information see the documentation realscripts.pdf.
