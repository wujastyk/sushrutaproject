    \item [1] 
    Now we shall describe the treatment of wind diseases.
    
    %\item [2] 
    weight

    \item [3] When the wind enters the stomach, one should sequentially give to
the patient, \diff{who has vomited}, the \se{yoga}{formulation} with
\se{ṣaḍdharaṇa}{six-units},  together with tepid water, for seven
nights.\footnote{The vulgate has the reading \dev{chardayitvā} which means
    "after making [him] vomit". Thus, vomiting is a part of the treatment.
    Whereas \dev{chardita} in the H manuscript is ambiguous:  vomiting may be 
    part of the treatment or a symptom of the ailment.
    
The expression “six units” refers to the six ingredients listed in the next
passage.  \Dalhana{4.4.3}{420} noted that \dev{dharaṇa} in this context 
means a
particular weight characterized as equivalent to 21 medium-sized \gls{niṣpāva}.
\citet[303]{shar-1999} proposed that that the formulation contains six
ingredients each the weight of a \emph{dharaṇa}.  See \Su{4.31.7}{508} where 
the
term \dev{dharaṇa} is defined in terms of other weights.  (In epigraphical 
Sanskrit, a \dev{dharaṇa} may be a silver or gold coin \citep[91]{sirc-1966}.)

 \AH\ \Ah{4.21.14}{723} is the same verse, mutatis mutandis, but the editor 
 noted 
 (f.n.\,6) a variant reading \dev{ṣaṭcaraṇa} in the commentary of Śrīkaṇṭha.  
 There seems to be some confusion about this expression.

Ḍalhaṇa also noted that \dev{sukhāmbu} (“pleasant water”) means “slightly 
warm water.”}

    \item [4]
    
    “Six-unit” is traditionally the formulation that is 
\gls{citraka}, \gls{indrayava}, \gls{pāṭhā},
\gls{kaṭukā}, \gls{ativiṣā}, and \gls{abhayā}. It cures serious
diseases.



    \item [5]
    When the wind has entered the \se{pakvāśa}{abdomen} one should treat it 
    with an oil purge. One should also treat it with cleansing enemas and very 
    salty foods.



    \item [6] When the wind has entered the bladder, a cleansing enema method
should be carried out. And once an inflamed wind is in the ears and the like,
a procedure that destroys wind should be done.

    \item [7]
    When the wind has reached the skin, flesh, and \diff{blood}, one should do 
    an 
    \se{abhyaṅga}{oil rub}, apply a \se{upanāha}{poultice},  
    \se{mardana}{rubbing} and \se{ālepana}{ointments}. One should also 
    perform blood-letting.\footnote{On the translation of methods of 
    medical touch, such as \dev{abhyaṅga} and \dev{saṃvāhana}, see 
    \cite[122--131]{broo-2021}.  \dev{mardana, unmardana} mean “pressing or 
    vigorous rubbing.”  The vulgate includes 
    \se{sirā}{ducts} as an added place that wind can enter.}

    \item[8]
    When the wind has got into the ligaments, joints, and bones, an expert 
    should apply  \se{sneha}{oleation},  a \se{upanāha}{poultice},
    \se{agnikarma}{cauterization}, binding, and \se{unmardana}{rubbing}.



    \item [9] When the wind is deep within the bone, then a strong physician
should insert a \se{nāḍī}{tube} into the bone, which has been split open by
\se{pāṇimantha}{manual agitation}, and suck out the wind.\footnote{The
    expression “which is split” could be construed with “wind.”  The word order
    is not obvious.  \Dalhana{4.4.9}{420} interpreted \dev{pāṇimantha} as the
    name of a particular awl and described the bone being pierced by this awl so
    that a double-headed tube can be inserted into the resulting opening.
    
    This verse is in \emph{na} vipulā metre.}
         
         
          
    % Ask Dominik Sir about the vipula types of anustup metre. Refer Ch. 106 of the Gita Darpana book of Svami Ramasukhadasa. It has many vipula variants, etc. of the anustup.        
    % My earlier comment in footnote: Also, the metre of this hemistich of the verse is not according to the \emph{anuṣṭup} metre. This gives us more reason to think that the reading \dev{asthīni} is corrupted.   

    \item[10ab]
    When the wind has reached the semen, one should perform the treatment 
    for the defects of the semen.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa comments 
    \citep[421]{vulgate} that this treatment for the defects of the semen is 
    mentioned [earlier] as the \dev{śukraśoṇitaśuddhi}, the purification of the 
    semen and the blood. This is the \emph{Śārīrasthāna} Ch. 2, 
    \dev{śukraśoṇitaviśuddhi}.}
    
    


    \item[10cd--11] 
    
When the wind has reached the whole body, an intelligent person should 
conquer
it by means of immersion, \se{kuṭī}{sauna}, \se{karṣū}{trench sweating},
\se{prastara}{blanket sweating}, oil massage, enema, and
blood-letting.\footnote{These forms of sweating treatment are described in the
    \CS\ (\Ca{1.14.39--63}{90--92}). %
    Regarding blood-letting, \Dalhana{4.4.11}{421} commented  there that 
    because
    the verse has the plural form \dev{sirāmokṣaiḥ}, five blood vessels have to
    be drained of blood if the wind is not pacified by oil massage, etc.} Or, if
    is located in a single limb and is stuck there, a thoughtful physician may
    conquer it with cow-horns.\footnote{\dev{śṛṅga} “cow-horns” refers to
        bloodletting by horn; see the description at \SS\ \Su{1.13.5}{55}.}
        
        %  got to here 2024-04-10
       
        
    \item[12]
    On the wind having mingled with phlegm, bile, and blood, the physician should treat it with non-hostile remedies. However, on the wind being inactive, the physician should perform blood-letting many times. 

    \item[13]
    [On the wind being inactive], one should also lick the milk of the \emph{pancamūlī} accompanied with salt and \gls{āgāradhūma}\footnote{\emph{Āgāradhūma} seems to be a plant as seen in Monier Williams' Sanskrit dictionary.} mixed with oil, and one should indeed consume meat soup made sour with fruit.\footnote{The vulgate reading \dev{dihyāt} (should apply) totally changes the meaning.}

    \item[14-15]
    Or, one should consume cereal soup with a good amount of ghee, or the food that is beneficial and that curtails the wind. However, \gls{kākolī}, etc.\footnote{For grammatical accuracy, there needs to be a \emph{visarga} at the end of the word \dev{kākolyādi}.} with a wind-removing remedy combined with all sour substances and with the meat from a water body along with lots of unction, lukewarm\footnote{Perhaps \dev{sukhoṣṇam} is an indeclinable. But, it could also be a grammatical inaccuracy where it should have a \textit{visarga} at the end: \dev{sukhoṣṇaḥ}.} and salty, is well known as \textit{Sālvala}.    

    \item[16ab]
    For patients with diseases of the wind, one should always apply this (\textit{sālvala}) as a poultice.
    
    \item[16cd-18ab]
     Whether a body part has become contracted or bent, is troubled by a [wind] disease, or has become numb, one should tightly bind it with a long strap made of tree bark, cloth, or wool [after applying the \textit{sālvala} poultice]. Or, after massaging the affected body part and applying the \textit{śālvala}\footnote{This seems to be the correct spelling as against the unclarity in the earlier verses.} poultice on it, one should insert it into a sack made of the hide of a cat, mongoose, \textit{udra}\footnote{some aquatic animal}, or deer.

    \item[18cd-19]
    Vomiting and \textit{nasya} done under the supervision of an expert physician alleviates the wind that has entered the chest, loins, shoulders, or the nape of the neck. \textit{Śirobasti} and blood-letting alleviate the wind situated in the head. 

    \item[20-21ab]
    In that (\textit{śirobasti}), the oil should be held carefully for a duration of one thousand \textit{mātrās}. Enema (\dev{basti}) alone curtails the wind that is situated throughout the whole body or in one part. This is just as the wind [curtails] its force.\footnote{The last four words in H, \dev{tasya vegam ivānilaḥ} do not make sense in the context.} 

    \item[21cd-26]
    Oils, perspiration, oil massage, enema, unctuous purging of the bowels, \textit{śirobasti}, oiling the head, unctuous smoke, gargling with lukewarm water, \textit{nasya}, unctuous paste\q{Perhaps \textit{kalka} here could also mean the \textit{Terminalia Bellerica} (\dev{vibhītaka}).}, milks, meats\footnote{The plural indicates milk and meat from various animals.}, soups, oils\footnote{This is the second occurrence of the word \dev{snehāḥ} in this sentence. This seems to be an anomaly.}, any unctuous substance, unctuous and salty meals that are made sour by fruits, bathing with lukewarm water, massages, saffron, \gls{aguru}, \gls{patra}, \gls{kuṣṭha}, \gls{elā}, \gls{tagara}, garments made of silk, wool, and fur, soft cotton garments, inner rooms with sunlight, no wind flow, and a soft bed, taking the warmth of fire, and celibacy, etc. are to be collectively employed for patients with wind diseases.    

    \item[27]
    One should take \textit{akṣa} quantities of unguent 
    pastes\footnote{\dev{kalka} also means an unguent paste. Refer to Apte's 
    dictionary.} of \gls{trivṛt},\footnote{In H, perhaps it should have been 
    \dev{trivṛd} instead of \dev{tṛvṛt}.} \gls{dantī}, \gls{śaṅkhinī}, 
    \gls{suvarṇṇakṣīrī}, \gls{triphalā}, and \gls{viḍaṅga}, a \gls{bilva} fruit 
    equivalent measure of \gls{tilvaka}-root and \gls{kampilya}, two 
    \textit{pātra} quantities of both 
    \textit{triphalā-}decoction\footnote{\dev{triphalārasa} is here taken to mean 
    a decoction of \textit{triphalā}.} and yogurt, and one \textit{pātra} measure 
    of ghee.\footnote{The exact measurements of \textit{akṣa} and \textit{pātra} 
    are given in Ḍalhaṇa's commentary in \cite[422]{vulgate}.} One should mix 
    these ingredients all at once and cook the mixture properly. This (resultant) is 
    \gls{tilvaka}-ghee. Unctuous purging of bowels is prescribed for treating wind 
    disorders.\footnote{It should be understood here that the unctuous substance 
    to be used for purging the bowels is the \gls{tilvaka}-ghee.}\\
    This procedure of making \gls{tilvaka}-ghee should also be referred for making \gls{aśoka}-ghee and \gls{ramyaka}-ghee.\footnote{\dev{aśoka} and \dev{ramyaka} are the Ashoka and Chinaberry respectively.}

    \item[28]
    One should collect the wooden logs of the instruments that have been used for a long time for extracting oil from sesame seeds. One should then have them chopped into very tiny pieces and then pound those pieces. Next, one should put them in a big vessel, submerge them in water, and boil them. Thereafter, one should collect the oil from the surface of the water with a goblet or by hand. Thereafter, one should properly cook wind-alleviating herbs with this oil that was effectively cooked.\footnote{In H, the word \dev{dantapratīvāyaṃ} in the compound word \dev{vātaghnauṣadhadantapratīvāyaṃ} does not appear to make sense. Perhaps the syllable \dev{ya} should be \dev{pa}, thus making the word \dev{pratīvāpaṃ} that refers to an admixture of substances to medicines either during or after decoction. Refer to Monier-Williams's Sanskrit dictionary.} This is the \textit{anutaila} (\dev{anutaila})\footnote{The \dev{n} should be read \dev{ṇ}.} that is mentioned in wind disorders. It is called \textit{anutaila} because it is produced from tiny oily objects.\footnote{The word \dev{anu} in the compound word \dev{anutailadravyebhyaḥ} should be read \dev{aṇu}.} 

    \item[29]
    Alternatively, one should burn a great amount of \gls{mahāpañcamūlī}-wood on the ground for one night. When the fire gets extinguished the ash should be removed. Then, the ground that is relieved of the fire should be soaked with a hundred pots of oil cooked with \gls{vidāri}, \gls{gandha}, and other herbs, and left in that condition for one night. Thereafter, one should take all the earth that is oily\footnote{In H, the word \dev{yāvan} should have been \dev{yāvān}.} in a big vessel and totally cover it with water.\footnote{The reading in H, \dev{kaṭāhebhyaḥ siṃcet}, does not make sense here. Thus, we have accepted the vulgate reading \dev{kaṭāhe 'bhyāsiṃcet} for the translation.} The oil that rises up in that vessel should be taken out with both hands and kept nicely covered. Thereafter, one should properly cook that oil for as long as possible\footnote{The phrase "\dev{yāvatā kālena śaknuyāt paktum}" appears as a part of a new sentence in H. But, we should take it to be a part of the earlier sentence for it to make proper sense.} with one thousand parts of each of the following---a decoction of wind-alleviating herbs, meat soup, milk, and \textit{kāñjika}\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa comments \citep[423]{vulgate} that the word \dev{amla} here means \dev{kāñjika} which is the water drained after boiling rice and is a little fermented. Refer Monier Willams's Sanskrit Dictionary.}---and thus prepare the \textit{sahasra-pāka} (that which is cooked with thousands). The admixture added to the oil contains the \textit{hemavata} herbs\footnote{The word should be \dev{haimavatāḥ} as in the vulgate. It means "the herbs of the snowy mountains". Ḍalhaṇa comments \citep[423]{vulgate} that \dev{haimavatāḥ} refers to the herbs that grow in the northern region.}, herbs of the southern region, \gls{aśvagandhā}, and other wind-alleviating herbs.\\
    While the oil is being cooked, conchshells should be blown loudly, umbrellas should be held, huge drums should be resounded, and whisk fans should be waved.\footnote{These activities are a symbolic way of showing reverence.} Thereafter, the perfectly cooked oil should be poured into a golden or silver pot and stored. This \textit{sahasra-pāka} is the oil possessing undiminishing potency and is fit for kings.\\
    Thus, that which is cooked with a thousand parts is called \textit{sahasra-pāka}.

    \item[30]
    One should collect fresh leaves of \gls{gandharvahasta}, \gls{aṭa}, \gls{ruṣkaka}, \gls{muṣkaka}, \gls{naktamāla}, \gls{pūtikā}, and \gls{citraka}.\footnote{In H, the ending \dev{nām} should be \dev{ṇām} due to sandhi.} These leaves should be completely pounded along with salt in a mortar. This mixture should be put in a pot filled with oil\footnote{\dev{snehaghaṭa} can also mean a pot filled with ghee}. It (pot) should be smeared\footnote{The H or vulgate do not specify with words that it is the pot to be smeared. But, it is to be understood.} with cow-dung. Thereafter, the pot should be heated.\footnote{The word \dev{dāhayet} usually refers to burning, but sometimes it can refer to heating.} This (resultant) is the \textit{patra-lavaṇa} (leaf-salt) that is mentioned in wind disorders. 

    \item[31]
    In the same way, one should pound the stalks of \gls{snuhā}\q{Euphorbia Antiquorum (Antique spurge)} and eggplants smeared with salt and fill a pot with it.\footnote{In H, there should be a \textit{visarga} after \dev{lavaṇā}.} In that pot, one should add ghee, oil, fat, and marrow. Then, one should smear it\footnote{As earlier, the pot should be smeared with cow-dung.} and heat it as earlier. This (resultant) is the \textit{sneha-lavaṇa} (fat-salt) that is mentioned in wind disorders.

    \item[32]
    One should collect the fresh fruits, roots, leaves, and branches of all the twenty [herbs]: \gls{gaṇḍīra}, \gls{palāśa}, \gls{kuṭaja}, \gls{bilva}, \gls{arka}, \gls{snuhā}, \gls{pāmārga}, \gls{pāṭalī}, \gls{pāribhadraka}, \gls{nādeyī}, \gls{kṛṣṇagandhā}, \gls{nīpa}, \gls{nirdahī}, \gls{ānyāṭa}, \gls{rūṣaka}, \gls{naktamāla}, \gls{pūtīka}, \gls{bṛhatī}, \gls{kaṇṭakārikā}, \gls{bhallātaka}, \gls{aśoka}, \gls{vaijayantī}. One should then mix them with salt and heat them as earlier.\footnote{It is to be understood that all these fresh branches, leaves, fruits, and roots of the herbs should be completely pounded together with salt. The mixture should then be put into a pot filled with oil or ghee. The pot should be smeared with cow-dung and then heated.} The oil on top should be poured out completely with the salty mixture intact [at the bottom]. This mixture should be cooked thoroughly. The admixture added to it consists of \gls{pippalī}, etc. This (resultant) is the salt called \textit{kalyāṇaka} that is mentioned in wind disorders and in meals and drinks for the patients troubled by \textit{plīhāgnisaṃga}, indigestion, loss of appetite, and piles.\\ 


    Thus ends the fourth chapter on the treatment of wind diseases.
