    \item [1] 
    Now we shall describe the treatment of wind diseases.
    
    %\item [2] 
    weight

    \item [3] When the wind enters the stomach, one should sequentially give to
the patient, \diff{who has vomited}, the \se{yoga}{formulation} with
\se{ṣaḍdharaṇa}{six-units},  together with tepid water, for seven
nights.\footnote{The vulgate has the reading \dev{chardayitvā} which means
    "after making [him] vomit". Thus, vomiting is a part of the treatment.
    Whereas \dev{chardita} in the H manuscript is ambiguous:  vomiting may be 
    part of the treatment or a symptom of the ailment.
    
The expression “six units” refers to the six ingredients listed in the
next passage.  \Dalhana{4.4.3}{420} noted that \dev{dharaṇa} in this
context means a particular weight characterized as equivalent to 21
medium-sized \gls{niṣpāva}.  \citet[303]{shar-1999} proposed that that
the formulation contains six ingredients each the weight of a
\emph{dharaṇa}.  See \Su{4.31.7}{508} where the term \dev{dharaṇa} is
defined in terms of other weights.  (In epigraphical Sanskrit, a
\dev{dharaṇa} may be a silver or gold coin \citep[91]{sirc-1966}.)

 \AH\ \Ah{4.21.14}{723} is the same verse, mutatis mutandis, but the editor 
 noted 
 (f.n.\,6) a variant reading \dev{ṣaṭcaraṇa} in the commentary of Śrīkaṇṭha.  
 There seems to be some confusion about this expression.

Ḍalhaṇa also noted that \dev{sukhāmbu} (“pleasant water”) means “slightly 
warm water.”}

    \item [4]
    
    “Six-unit” is traditionally the formulation that is 
\gls{citraka}, \gls{indrayava}, \gls{pāṭhā},
\gls{kaṭukā}, \gls{ativiṣā}, and \gls{abhayā}. It cures serious
diseases.



    \item [5]
    When the wind has entered the \se{pakvāśa}{abdomen} one should treat it 
    with an oil purge. One should also treat it with cleansing enemas and very 
    salty foods.



    \item [6] When the wind has entered the bladder, a cleansing enema method
should be carried out. And once an inflamed wind is in the ears and the like,
a procedure that destroys wind should be done.

    \item [7]
    When the wind has reached the skin, flesh, and \diff{blood}, one should do 
    an 
    \se{abhyaṅga}{oil rub}, apply a \se{upanāha}{poultice},  
    \se{mardana}{rubbing} and \se{ālepana}{ointments}. One should also 
    perform blood-letting.\footnote{On the translation of methods of 
    medical touch, such as \dev{abhyaṅga} and \dev{saṃvāhana}, see 
    \cite[122--131]{broo-2021}.  \dev{mardana, unmardana} mean “pressing or 
    vigorous rubbing.”  The vulgate includes 
    \se{sirā}{ducts} as an added place that wind can enter.}

    \item[8]
    When the wind has got into the ligaments, joints, and bones, an expert 
    should apply  \se{sneha}{oleation},  a \se{upanāha}{poultice},
    \se{agnikarma}{cauterization}, binding, and \se{unmardana}{rubbing}.



    \item [9] When the wind is deep within the bone, then a strong
physician should insert a \se{nāḍī}{tube} into the bone, which has
been split open by \se{pāṇimantha}{manual agitation}, and suck out
the wind.\footnote{Although gramatically the expression “which is
    split” could be construed with “wind,” it has to be understood
    here as referring to the bone.  The word order is not obvious. 
    \Dalhana{4.4.9}{420} interpreted \dev{pāṇimantha} as the name of a
    particular awl and described the bone being pierced by this awl so
    that a double-headed tube can be inserted into the resulting
    opening.
    
    This verse is in \emph{na} vipulā metre.}
         
         
          
    % Ask Dominik Sir about the vipula types of anustup metre. Refer Ch. 106 of the Gita Darpana book of Svami Ramasukhadasa. It has many vipula variants, etc. of the anustup.        
    % My earlier comment in footnote: Also, the metre of this hemistich of the verse is not according to the \emph{anuṣṭup} metre. This gives us more reason to think that the reading \dev{asthīni} is corrupted.   

    \item[10ab]
    When the wind has reached the semen, one should perform the treatment 
    for the defects of the semen.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa comments 
    \citep[421]{vulgate} that this treatment for the defects of the semen is 
    mentioned [earlier] as the \dev{śukraśoṇitaśuddhi}, the purification of the 
    semen and the blood. This is the \emph{Śārīrasthāna} Ch. 2, 
    \dev{śukraśoṇitaviśuddhi}.}
    
    


    \item[10cd--11] 
    
When the wind has reached the whole body, an intelligent person should
conquer it by means of immersion, \se{kuṭī}{sauna}, \se{karṣū}{trench
    sweating}, \se{prastara}{blanket sweating}, oil massage, enema, and
blood-letting.\footnote{These forms of sweating treatment are
    described in the \CS\ (\Ca{1.14.39--63}{90--92}).
    
Regarding blood-letting, \Dalhana{4.4.11}{421} commented  that because
the verse has the plural form \dev{sirāmokṣaiḥ}, five blood vessels
have to be drained of blood if the wind is not pacified by oil
massage, etc.} Or, if is located in a single limb and is stuck there,
a thoughtful physician may conquer it with
cow-horns.\footnote{\dev{śṛṅga} “cow-horns” refers to bloodletting by
    horn; see the description at \SS\ \Su{1.13.5}{55}.}
        
       
            
    \item[12] 
    
    Or, if it is mingled with \se{balāsa}{phlegm}, bile, and
blood, the physician should treat it with 
remedies that are \se{avirodhin}{compatible}.\footnote{The word 
\dev{balāsa} is used here in the
    slightly unusual meaning “phlegm;” see \Dalhana{1.45.70,
    6.61.33}{202, 802} and \cite[553]{josi-maha}.} However, when the
    wind is inactive, he should perform blood-letting many
    times.\footnote{We read \dev{suptavāte} with witness H, but
        Ḍalhaṇa glossed \dev{supti-}, the reading of the vulgate, “it is
        wind characterized by \se{supti}{drowsiness} caused by a covering
        of blood.”}

    \item[13]
    
     And one should lick the milk cooked in \gls{pañcamūlī}
together with salt and \se{āgāradhūma}{soot from the chimney},
mixed with oil and also a \se{rasa}{juice} that has the sourness of
a fruit.\footnote{The vulgate reading \dev{dihyāt} for the Nepalese 
\dev{lihyāt} changes the meaning to “one should smear.”
    
    \Dalhana{4.4.13}{421} glossed \dev{pañcamūlī} as optionally the first  or 
    the second five roots.  On this therapy, cf.\ Cakrapāṇi's commentary on 
    \Ca{1.5.3}{36} for a similar therapy.
    
    The “juice” (\dev{rasa}) was glossed by Ḍalhaṇa as specifically
being a \se{māṃsarasa}{meat broth}.   He said that the sourness
may come from fruits such as pomegranate.
    
  \dev{rasāmla} may mean a vinegar made from fruit  
\citep[70]{moni-sans}, so the expression \dev{phalāmlo rasaḥ} in the
text here may mean a vinegar made from sour fruit. Cf.\
\dev{dhānyāmla}.}
    

    \item[14--16ab]
    
    Alternatively, cereal soup with a good amount of ghee is a
wholesome food that repels wind. However, a \emph{śālvala} poultice is 
famous 
as being a lukewarm and very salty substance made of the
\gls{kākolī} group combined with an item that repels wind and
together with all the sour drugs and the meat of creatures from
marshes and water that have all the oils.\footnote{Cf.\
    \dev{sālvaṇa} “sweat from a poultice” in \cite[898]{josi-maha}.
    \AS\ \As{1.26.3}{188} describes a poultice called “sālvala” made
    with numerous ingredients (the commentator Indu elaborates,
    p.\,189). \cite[1068]{moni-sans} glossed \dev{śālvaṇa} as “a
    poultice, cataplasm,” based on the \SS.}
            %\item[16ab]
        One should always apply a bandage with that to people who are 
        ill with wind. 
   
   \item[16cd-18ab]
   
   One should tightly bind someone who is bent, afflicted by pain,
   or whose limbs are \se{stabdha}{numb}, with a 
   \se{paṭṭa}{strip of cloth} made of bark, cotton or \se{ūrṇa}{wool}.
   
Alternatively, after massaging the affected body part and applying the
\emph{śālvala} poultice on it, one should insert it into a sack made
of the hide of a 
\gls{biḍāla}, 
\gls{nakula}, or 
\gls{udra}, or else of
\gls{mṛga}.\footnote{For \dev{goṇī}, \citeauthor[367]{moni-sans} recorded
``sack'' and ``torn or ragged clothes;'' it may have been a sling or
similar support.}
    
    
    
\item[18cd--19]
     
    Vomiting and an errhine done skilfully alleviate the wind that has
entered the chest, \se{trika}{between the shoulder-blades}, the
shoulders, or the nape of the neck.\footnote{On \dev{trika}, see
    \volcite{1}[387]{josi-maha}, citing \Dalhana{3.6.26}{374} “the
    junction between the shoulder-blades and the neck.”} The  wind  located in 
    the head is defeated by blood-letting and by the 
    \se{śirobasti}{application of oil to the head}.
    
    
    
     \item[20--21ab] 
     
     In that context, one should let the oil remain carefully for 
one thousand \se{mātrā}{measures}.\footnote{\Dalhana{4.2.20}{422}
    interpreted \dev{mātrā} as a measure of time, citing an
    unattributed verse defining it as the time of a blink, a snap of
    the fingers or the utterance of a single vowel. The expression
    might possibly be taken to refer to a measure of the oil's
    volume.} Only an \se{basti}{enema} can curtail the wind,  whether
    it is throughout the whole body or in just one limb.  Its
    \se{vega}{force} is like the wind.\footnote{This phrase is
        awkward. The idea here seems to be that an enema decisively stops
        the wind.  The vulgate revised this to make it more obvious:
        “only an enema can block the force of the wind, like a
        mountain.”}

    \item[21cd--26]
    
Oils, perspiration, oil massage, enema, unctuous purging of the
bowels, \emph{śirobasti}, oiling the head, unctuous smoke, gargling
with lukewarm water, errhines, an \se{kalka}{oily
    paste},
    %\footnote{\dev{kalka} ``oily paste'' here might also refer to
    %\gls{vibhītaka}.}, 
    milks, meats,\footnote{The plural indicates milk and
        meat from various animals.} soups, oils,\footnote{This is the second
            occurrence of the word \dev{snehāḥ} in this sentence. This seems to be
            an anomaly.} any unctuous substance, unctuous and salty meals that
            are made sour by fruits, bathing with lukewarm water, massages,
            saffron, \gls{aguru}, \gls{patra}, \gls{kuṣṭha}, \gls{elā},
            \gls{tagara}, garments made of silk, wool, and fur, soft cotton
            garments, inner rooms with sunlight, no wind flow, and a soft bed,
            taking the warmth of fire, and celibacy, etc., are to be collectively
            employed for patients with wind diseases.

    

    \item[27]
    
One should take 12 grams each of \se{kalka}{pastes} of \gls{trivṛt},
\gls{dantī}, \gls{śaṅkhinī}, \gls{suvarṇakṣīrī}, \gls{triphalā}, and
\gls{viḍaṅga}, with 48 grams of \gls{tilvaka}-root and \gls{kampilya},
and six kilos of the juice of \gls{triphalā} and curds and three kilos
of ghee.\footnote{The measure of 12 grams is expressed as an
    \dev{akṣa}.  See \cite[263]{wuja-2003}, which is based on the
    fourteenth-century \emph{Śārṅgadharasaṃhitā}.  The measure of 48\,g is
    a \dev{bilva}, more commonly called a \dev{pala} (\emph{idem}).  Six
    kilos is two \dev{pātra}, which is a liquid measure of approximately 2
    $\times$ 3\,kg (\emph{idem}).  There is one \dev{pātra} of ghee.
    \Dalhana{4.4.27}{422}
                commented on the measurements mentioned in this recipe.} One 
                should
                then mix these ingredients all together and cook the mixture. This is
                called the \gls{tilvaka}-ghee. They prescribe this oily bowel purge in
                cases of wind disorder.
                
                 This procedure for making \gls{tilvaka}-ghee
                    should followed for making \gls{aśoka}-ghee and
                    \gls{ramyaka}-ghee.




    \item[28] 
    
Take wood that has been used in instruments for grinding sesame seeds.
Chop those that have been used  to grind the sesame seeds for a long
time into tiny pieces.  Next, crush them, put them into a large pot of
water and make them into a paste. Then, collect the oil from the
surface of the water, either with a cup or by hand, and cook it into a
\se{pratīvāpa}{mixture} that has herbs that destroy wind added to it,
following the \se{oil-cooking}{snehapāka} method.\footnote{This
    special method of preparing oil in three grades is described at \SS\
    \Su{4.31.11}{509}. See also \volcite{1}[944]{josi-maha}.} This is the
    \se{aṇutaila}{fine oil} that is mentioned in wind disorders. It is
    called \se{aṇutaila}{fine oil} because it is produced from ingredients
    of \se{aṇu}{fine} oil.



    \item[29] Alternatively, one should scorch a patch of earth using
many sticks of \gls{mahāpañcamūlī}-wood for one night. Then, when
the fire has gone out, the ash should be removed.  Then, the
extinguished earth should be soaked with a hundred pots of sesame
oil cooked with herbs like \gls{vidāri} and \gls{gandhauṣadha},
and left in that condition for one
night.\footnote{\volcite{1B}[104, n.\,123]{meul-hist} noted that
    the \CS\ \Ca{6.26.23, 74}{598, 602} stated that the
    \dev{vidārigandhādi} group is the same as the
    \dev{hrasvapañcamūla} or the \dev{sthirādi} groups.} Next, one
    should put all the earth that is oily in water, and then pour it into a large 
    caldron.
%     \footnote{The reading in H,
%            \dev{kaṭāhebhyaḥ siṃcet}, does not make sense here. Thus, we have
%            accepted the vulgate reading \dev{kaṭāhe 'bhyāsiṃcet} for the
%            translation.} 
            The oil that rises up in that vessel should be taken
            out with both hands and stored well covered.  Next, one
            should thoroughly cook that oil a thousand times 
            for as long as possible 
%            \footnote{The
%                phrase "\dev{yāvatā kālena śaknuyāt paktum}" appears as a part of
%                a new sentence in H. But, we should take it to be a part of the
%                earlier sentence for it to make proper sense.} 
                parts of each of the following---
                
                a decoction of wind-alleviating
                herbs, meat soup, milk, and sours
                
                \textit{kāñjika}\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa
                    comments \citep[423]{vulgate} that the word \dev{amla} here 
                    means
                    \dev{kāñjika} which is the water drained after boiling rice and is
                    a little fermented. Refer Monier Willams's Sanskrit
                    Dictionary.}---and thus prepare the \textit{sahasra-pāka} (that
                    which is cooked with thousands). The admixture added to the oil
                    contains the \textit{hemavata} herbs\footnote{The word should be
                        \dev{haimavatāḥ} as in the vulgate. It means "the herbs of the
                        snowy mountains". Ḍalhaṇa comments \citep[423]{vulgate} that
                        \dev{haimavatāḥ} refers to the herbs that grow in the northern
                        region.}, herbs of the southern region, \gls{aśvagandhā}, and
                        other wind-alleviating herbs.\\ While the oil is being cooked,
                        conchshells should be blown loudly, umbrellas should be held, 
                        huge
                        drums should be resounded, and whisk fans should be
                        waved.\footnote{These activities are a symbolic way of showing
                            reverence.} Thereafter, the perfectly cooked oil should be 
                            poured
                            into a golden or silver pot and stored. This 
                            \textit{sahasra-pāka}
                            is the oil possessing undiminishing potency and is fit for
                            kings.\\ Thus, that which is cooked with a thousand parts is
                            called \textit{sahasra-pāka}.


      \bigskip       
\begin{tt}
    \marginpar{Draft tr.\ from here}

    \item[30]
    One should collect fresh leaves of \gls{gandharvahasta}, \gls{aṭa}, 
    \gls{ruṣkaka}, \gls{muṣkaka}, \gls{naktamāla}, \gls{pūtikā}, and 
    \gls{citraka}.\footnote{In H, the ending \dev{nām} should be \dev{ṇām} 
    due to sandhi.} These leaves should be completely pounded along with salt 
    in a mortar. This mixture should be put in a pot filled with 
    oil\footnote{\dev{snehaghaṭa} can also mean a pot filled with ghee}. It 
    (pot) should be smeared\footnote{The H or vulgate do not specify with 
    words that it is the pot to be smeared. But, it is to be understood.} with 
    cow-dung. Thereafter, the pot should be heated.\footnote{The word 
    \dev{dāhayet} usually refers to burning, but sometimes it can refer to 
    heating.} This (resultant) is the \textit{patra-lavaṇa} (leaf-salt) that is 
    mentioned in wind disorders. 

    \item[31]
    In the same way, one should pound the stalks of \gls{snuhā}\q{Euphorbia 
    Antiquorum (Antique spurge)} and eggplants smeared with salt and fill a pot 
    with it.\footnote{In H, there should be a \textit{visarga} after 
    \dev{lavaṇā}.} In that pot, one should add ghee, oil, fat, and marrow. Then, 
    one should smear it\footnote{As earlier, the pot should be smeared with 
    cow-dung.} and heat it as earlier. This (resultant) is the 
    \textit{sneha-lavaṇa} (fat-salt) that is mentioned in wind disorders.

    \item[32]
    One should collect the fresh fruits, roots, leaves, and branches of all the 
    twenty [herbs]: \gls{gaṇḍīra}, \gls{palāśa}, \gls{kuṭaja}, \gls{bilva}, 
    \gls{arka}, \gls{snuhā}, \gls{pāmārga}, \gls{pāṭalī}, \gls{pāribhadraka}, 
    \gls{nādeyī}, \gls{kṛṣṇagandhā}, \gls{nīpa}, \gls{nirdahī}, \gls{ānyāṭa}, 
    \gls{rūṣaka}, \gls{naktamāla}, \gls{pūtīka}, \gls{bṛhatī}, \gls{kaṇṭakārikā}, 
    \gls{bhallātaka}, \gls{aśoka}, \gls{vaijayantī}. One should then mix them 
    with salt and heat them as earlier.\footnote{It is to be understood that all 
    these fresh branches, leaves, fruits, and roots of the herbs should be 
    completely pounded together with salt. The mixture should then be put into 
    a pot filled with oil or ghee. The pot should be smeared with cow-dung and 
    then heated.} The oil on top should be poured out completely with the salty 
    mixture intact [at the bottom]. This mixture should be cooked thoroughly. 
    The admixture added to it consists of \gls{pippalī}, etc. This (resultant) is 
    the salt called \textit{kalyāṇaka} that is mentioned in wind disorders and in 
    meals and drinks for the patients troubled by \textit{plīhāgnisaṃga}, 
    indigestion, loss of appetite, and piles.


    Thus ends the fourth chapter on the treatment of wind diseases.
