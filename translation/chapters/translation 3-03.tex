\item[1] 

We shall now explain the anatomy that is the descent of the embryo. 

%We are now about to begin to explain how the embryo is conceived, 
%nestles and develops* once it arrives in the body.

\item[3]

Semen is \se{saumya}{of the nature of Soma} and menstrual blood is
\se{āgneya}{of the nature of Agni}.\footnote{On the Saumya--Agni
    classification, see \cites{wuja-2004}{ange-2021}[521--527]{das-2003}. 
    The fiery nature of menstrual blood is already stated in
    \Su{1.14.7}{59}, “\ldots but menstrual blood is of the nature of
    Agni, because the embryo is of the nature of fire and water.”} 
Furthermore, in this context there also exists a proximity of the
other elements (\emph{bhūta})\sse{bhūta}{element}, by way of a minute
special property\sse{aṇu}{minute}\sse{viśeṣa}{special property},
because they help one another and they enter into one
another.\footnote{\Dalhana{3.3.3}{350} glossed \dev{aṇunā viśeṣeṇa}
    “by way of a minute special property” as \dev{sūkṣmaprakāreṇa} “in an
    attenuated manner.”
        
        \Dalhana{3.3.3}{350} drew attention
        to \Su{3.1.21ab}{343} where the idea of this interpenetration
        (\dev{anupraveśa}) is mentioned.}


\item [4]

In this case,
when there is a union of \diff{a husband and wife},
the heat from the body stimulates the wind.

In that case, 
because of the \se{sannipāta}{combination} of fire and wind,
the semen that is ejaculated finds its way to the vagina. 

It is commingled with \se{ārtava}{menstrual blood}, then because
of the joining together of Agni and Soma, what is being mingled together
arrives in the receptacle of the fetus. 

It is referred to by names that express synonyms such as,
the knower of the field,
sentient, 
the toucher,
the smeller,
the seer,
the hearer,
the taster, 
the person,
the goer,
the witness,
the creator,
the speaker,
the one who

%Sperm from the male absorbs heat whereas eggs from the female 
%release heat. With respect to this aspect, the way the different basic 
%elements of 
%matter behave depends on how the elements specifically react with one 
%another 
%and how they form bonds with one another.  

\item[4]



%The wind aggravates the heat caused by the bodily frictions during 
%sexual intercourse between husband and wife. Hence heat and wind colligate 
%and displace the sperm towards the vagina. There it gets combined with the 
%female element, thanks to the matrimonial fusion of agni and saumya, and is 
%confined towards the uterus, its new realm where it is respectfully known by 
%many names and synonymous descriptions such as he who touches, smells, 
%looks and sees, hears, tastes, as the animating principle of all living beings, as 
%he who wanders, observes and witnesses, the creator, he who remains 
%incomprehensible even though eternal. So it claimed. 
Because of the connection 
with the divine, the conceptus subsequently makes its entry into the reproductive 
organs, where it remains exempt from decay, imperishable and to be meditated 
upon, the soul of all beings that exist, marked by the concomitance of the three 
states-of-mind, the sattvic, the rajasic and the tamasic, and of the different 
Devas and Asuras, enraptured as it is by Vāyu.

\item[5]When there is an excess of male sperm, boys originate. When there is an 
excess of the female element, girls. And when there is a balance between both, 
the sex of the child remains unclear.*

\item[6]A boy is conceived when on the first day of the period of twelve days of 
the cycle* the desire for sexual intercourse is not endlessly postponed. It should 
not be disregarded that a woman who is definitely pregnant may  suffer a 
miscarriage; a second pregnancy can miscary as well and even in a third 
gestation, the body can be incomplete either in form or in number of limbs, and 
both the strength and the life expectancy can be limited. This is the reason why 
one should avoid three-nightly intervals. There are also patients who do not 
exhibit produce menstrual periods or have no sperm production and who do not 
return to normality.* For that reason, if sperm production has to be observed, a 
man should avoid the habit of three-nightly advances. In such cases, even after 
having observed there periods of twelve nights, yet there is no ovulation 
proper.** Some state that these are amenorrhoeic.*** 

\item[7]Here are some more verses.

\item[8] Lacking

\item[9]As surely as by rule of nature the night-lotus folds its leaves, so truly a 
woman’s yoni by law of nature is also closing*.

\item[9A]The face of a woman becomes swollen, lively and because of 
transudation moist like that of an elephant, she longs for intimate contact with a 
man, talks sweetly, her belly drooping and her head let down/uncared for,…

\item[9B]… her arms, breasts, hips, loins, thighs, her abdomen around the navel, 
her bottom and buttocks, all are trembling. And she experiences intense 
happiness and satisfaction, you can tell her a woman after her courses. 

\item[10]The Vāyu then guides the mentrual discharge that comes after being 
heaped up for a month through the two channels towards the opening of the yoni.

\item[11]Menstruation becomes a regular feat from twelve years onwards and 
owing to the natural decay of functions it ends from about fifty years onwards.

\item[12]So, if a man desires children, he should have intercourse with his wife 
during the fertile period of the cycle* and for that particular purpose he should 
visit her on even days in order to beget a boy and on uneven days for a girl.**

\item[13]In this context, fatigue, lassitude, thirst, a feeling of exhaustion in the 
thighs, flatulence, an arrest of the menses – and of sperm from the yoni* - with a 
sensation of shaking heat all suggest that a pregnancy has been obtained very 
recently.

\item[14]Here are some more verses. It is claimed that a typical early sign of 
pregnancy is the nipples turning darker*, the appearance, on the midline of the 
abdomen, of a coloured stripe, (resembling hair)** and sudden vomiting.

\item[15] Lacking

\item[16]From the very beginning of pregnancy the woman should avoid sexual 
intercourse, exertion, excessive exercise, sleeping by day and waking at night, 
being terrified, sitting for too long in one position, being all alone, Sneha-krama 
and other treatments as well as blood-letting at an inappropriate time.


\item[17] Lacking

\item[18]So then, in the first month a kalala arises. In the second month a ghana 
develops that has arisen thanks to blood, ritual oblations and by wind and has 
become mature with the five essential elements. If there is a lump-like structure, 
it will be a male. If the structure is oblong or peśī, a girl; if there is a bud-shaped 
structure  or arbbuda, an individual with undifferentiated external sexual 
features.* In the third month five protrusions (of hands, feet and head) result 
from the process of development.  All limbs and all minor body parts become 
distinguishable (though still) very minute. In the fourth month all limbs and minor 
body parts become manifest. In the fifth month all limbs and minor body parts 
become even more individualized. Owing to the formation of an individualized 
fetal heart, consciousness becomes a distinct separate constituent which is why 
during the fourth month, that foetus, from the appearance of that organ onwards, 
forms desires from (all five) objects of sense. Henceforth the lady becomes the 
double-hearted (or pregnant) one and she makes her desires known.  The 
two-hearted/pregnant one, (if) disrespected, causes a child to be born who is  
……………………………….. (kukukūniṃṣaṇṛm),  dwarfish, with eye defects, blind, 
……………………….. (vānārīsutam). That on which account she desires 
(something) is also that by means of which she can be gratified. Having obtained 
(to be) pregnant, she causes a son to be born who is really strong and has a long 
life expectancy. 

\item[19]And here are some more verses. Indeed that pregnant woman desires 
…………… (bhoktum) the objects of the senses during the course (of her 
pregnancy); for fear of injury to the foetus a physician, after having fetched these 
things, should give any desired object.

\item[20]She should give birth to a son endowed with virtues; if the pregnant 
woman does not obtain (what she desires), he (the foetus?) (or she, the woman?) 
also becomes equally insecure him-/her-self.

\item[21]With respect to all those desires of the senses in which the pregnant 
mother was slighted, she will give birth to a son who is defective in each of all 
those same corresponding senses.

\item[22]A king in an interview with whom a woman during her pregnancy wins 
and she gives birth to a son who is wealthy and is highly fortunate.*

\item[23]A pregnant woman, dressed in fine cloth, wearing silk and other things, 
gives birth to a charming son decorated (alaṇkā) …………. reṣiṇaṃ


\item[24]If (she goes) to a hermitage, she brings forth someone who is 
self-restrained and a stone-pillar of religion, resembling a godhead and begotten 
in the utmost happiness. Upon seeing someone in a high position designed by 
birth, she gives birth to a stone-pillar of violence.

\item[25]If she feels like eating the flesh of an Iguana (she produces) a son who 
is drowsy and who has the nature of a killer; by means of beef meat a son who is 
wild and who is powerful because he is savage in everything.

\item[26] When from the pregnant woman (there is a wish for meat of) buffalo a 
son is produced who has fearful red-eyes and who looks shaggy.

\item[27]Lacking

\item[28]Hence, she who during her pregnancy considers what people eat, 
wishes for her offspring the same via the food habits of the body.

\item[29] And that which has yet to happen again when the child is growing up, 
should be such that through divine intervention the pregnant woman should 
produce it during her pregnancy. 

\item[30]In the fifth (month of pregnancy) the mindbecomes more and more 
awakened; in the sixth intelligence (becomes awakened); in the seventh all the 
limbs and smaller body parts (are in place); if in the eighth (month) the ojas is 
not stable in that case the child does not live* - he is provided with a share (of it) 
by the demons– so then strong excellent meat should be provided to him; if he is 
not yet caused to be born in the ninth, tenth, eleventh or twelfth  (month), then 
there is something wrong.

\item[31]Furthermore, the umbilical cord is securely fastened to both 
juice-carrying vessels of the mother and carries the power (energy?) of the 
essential juice coming from the food of the mother and what causes (the baby) to 
live is the distribution of the life juice,* over all the body parts of the not yet 
(existing) newborn, from the beginning of conception (?) (niḥṣekān), and over 
(all) the transportation channels, running in all directions because of that 
intimate connection of the vessels.

\item[32]Mainly, the developments of the foetus are: śaunakasays says that the 
head develops first because it is at the basis of this (development). 
Kṛtavīryasaysit states is the heart (which is at the base) of both intellect and 
mind. Pārāsa’ s son maintains instead that (it is) ……………….. (deraha?-) of the 
body. Mārkkandeya presumes that hands and feet are first because they are at 
the basis of movement in the body of the foetus. Subhūti Gautama claims all the 
limbs and their smaller subparts develop because of their development because 
the development of all the moving limbs is irretrievably connected, all turned 
into one and the same direction (of the thorax) together. At the time of early 
pregnancy, due to their extreme minuteness, they cannot be perceived, like 
sprouts of bamboo or seeds of mango. Thus, in the manner mango fruits 
becomes ripe, or as the shine of the hair of the head, or the way marrow appears 
in bones, step by step these things are seen more accurately, e.g. as an increase 
of black colour, and they become gradually apparent as the body (takes shape). 
Due to their feature of being so subtle, the minuteness of the hair of the head 
(and other examples) makes the black become apparent in this way; just so the 
growth of bamboo is also explained. Similarly in the beginning of a pregnancy, 
precisely  because of the minuteness in all limbs and smaller body parts which 
are present, these are not well perceived (but) because of their increasing 
degree of blackness they become apparent.

\item[33] It is claimed (that this) is not the consequence of any previous or any 
(bad or) excellent fate but solely because of the minuteness  they* are not being 
observed. In that context we shall explain features in the body that are paternal, 
maternal, connected with rasa, related to the soul, linked to the quietude of mind 
and relative to the essence of being.** Keeping this in mind, the hair of the head, 
tears, teeth, nails, the hair of beard and moustache, things made of hard 
substance (cartilage?)*** are brought about as paternal (elements). Muscle, 
blood, fat, marrow, the heart, the umbilicus (= the placenta? )****, the liver, the 
spleen, the intestines, the anus are brought about as the soft maternal 
(elements). The increase in size of the body, the growth of the child and (its) 
outward appearance, the gain and loss of its erect attitude are caused by the 
rasa. The senses, consciousness, duration of life and the intensity of pleasure 
and pain are related to the spiritual element. We shall discuss later the 
satva-related things. Valour, healthfulness, strength, complexion and prudence 
depend on the existential disposition.**

\item[34] In this context a woman in whose right breast  milk appears first,* 
(whose) right flankis the larger one  and leg shall be lifted first on the right sid, 
and  who is occupied for the largest part during pregnancy with things that are 
identified) by male names, and in her sleep receives lotuses, blue lotus 
blossoms, Kumud-flowers, āmrāmrātaka**-flowers and so on, or precisely with 
male names, and who has an enhanced facial complexion, it is proclaimed to be 
likely (bhavetām?) (that) it will lead to the birth of that son. In case of the 
opposite of this (it will lead to) a girl. She whose both sides are bent down and 
(whose) aformentioned  belly is bulging  forward, the typical feature from this 
knowledge is a sexless individual. She whose abdomen is sunk in the middle will 
produce  …………….. (prābhūtamu?) twins . 

\item[35]And here is (more). Women who sit down to the gods and Brahmins, 
have the advantage of a ceremonially pure offspring. They produce children with 
great qualities. In the opposite case however, they have no qualities. 

\item[36] The development of the limbs and the smaller anatomical parts  
progresses  precisely all according to its own nature. The development of these 
limbs and the smaller anatomical parts is dependent upon the qualities and 
conditions which could not be known of the foetus by religion and could not be 
caused by religion.*
