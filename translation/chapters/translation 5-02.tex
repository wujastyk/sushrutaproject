\chapter{Kalpasthāna 2: Poisonous Plants}

\section{Introduction}

This section begins with several lists of poisonous plants.  The Sanskrit names
for these plants are mostly not standard or familiar from anywhere in Sanskrit or
ethnobotanical literature.  It remains a historical puzzle why these particular
names are so difficult to interpret. However, we are not the first to encounter
these difficulties. In the twelfth century, the learned commentator on the text,
Ḍalhaṇa, remarked,
\begin{quote}
In spite of having made the greatest effort, it has been impossible to identify
these plants. In the Himalayan regions, Kirātas and Śabaras are able to identify
them.\footnote{After \SS, \emph{kalpasthāna} 2.5 \citep[564]{vulgate}. From the
view of Sanskrit authors, Kirāṭas and Śabaras were tribal peoples.  The
eleventh-century author Bhikṣu Govinda, however, cast his treatise as a dialogue 
with a
Kirāṭa king called Madana who was a master of the alchemical art \citep[IIA,
620]{meul-hist}.}
\end{quote}
Ḍalhaṇa also recorded variant readings of these poison names from the manuscripts
that he consulted of the lost commentary of Gayadāsa (fl.\ c.\ \AD\ 1000). The
identities of these poisons have been in doubt for at least a thousand
years.\footnote{See \cite[80--81]{wuja-2003}.}  Identifications have in many cases
    been equally impossible for us today.

One path for exploration in this situation is to attempt to reverse-engineer some 
identifications by considering the known toxic plants of India.\footnote{Valuable 
reference sources on Indian plant toxicology in general include 
\cite[chs.\,10, 11]{pill-2013} and \cite[parts 1.II, 3 and 4]{barc-2008}.}

    \item[1]
    And now I shall explain \diff{what should be known} about stationary 
    poisons.\footnote{No reference is made to Dhanvantari 
    \citep[see][]{birc-2021}. “Stationary” here is a term contrasted with “moving,” 
    and signifies plants as opposed to animals and insects.}
  
    \item[3]
    \noindent It is said that there are two kinds of poisons,
    \se{sthāvara}{stationary} and \se{jaṅgama}{mobile}. The former
    dwells in ten sites, the latter in sixteen places.
   
    \item[4]
    Traditionally, the ten are: root, leaf, fruit, flower, bark,
    \se{kṣīra}{milky sap}, \se{sāra}{pith}, \se{niryāsa}{resin}, the
    elements (\emph{dhātu})\sse{dhātu}{element}, and the tuber.

    \item[5]
    
    In that context,\label{poisonousplants}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the eight root-poisons are:\footnote{Some South Asian plants with
    poisonous roots that we would have expected to see in this list include
    \emph{Croton tiglium}, L., \emph{Calotropis} spp., \emph{Citrullus colocynthus} L. 
    Schrad., and \emph{Ricinus
    communis} L.\ \citep{pill-2010}.} 
%    \q{Expected \citep{pill-2010}:\\ Croton
%        tiglium, L. = Naepala, Jayapala, kanakaphala, titteriphala (NL \#720);
%        Calotropis spp.;\\ Citrullus colocynthus (colocynth);\\ Ricinus communis
%        (castor); }
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item  \gls{klītaka},\footnote{Liquorice eaten in excess can be poisonous, but it is 
        unlikely to be the plant intended here.  \citet[124]{gvdb} noted that the 
        poisonous 
        root mentioned in this passage, “remains to be idenitified.”}
       
        \item \gls{aśvamāraka},\footnote{The roots of sweet-scented oleander 
        are highly toxic, as are most parts of the plant \citep{pill-2019}.}
    
        \item \gls{guñjā},\footnote{Jequirity contains a dangerous
        toxin called Abrin in its seeds and to a lesser extent in its leaves,
        but apparently not in its roots or bulb. Abrin is not harmful if eaten,
        but an infusion of the bruised (not boiled) seeds injected or rubbed in
        the eyes can be fatal \citep[\# 6]{NK}.  The dose can be quite small.}
        
        \item \diff{\gls{subhaṅgurā}},\footnote{The plant is
usually called just \emph{bhaṅgurā} without the prefix \emph{su-} “good.”  However, there 
is no reported toxicity associated with \emph{E. prostrata}.  The vulgate reads 
\dev{sugandhā} (\gls{sugandhā}).}
        
       \item \diff{\gls{karaṭā}},\footnote{This poisonous root cannot at present
be securely identified.  Similar-sounding candidates include \emph{karkaṭaka},
\emph{karahāṭa} (emetic nut), and \emph{karaghāṭa}, but since this is a
prose passage, there would be no reason to alter the word to fit a metre.
\citet[255]{moni-sans} cite an unknown lexical source that equates
\emph{karaṭa} (mn.) with safflower (\emph{Carthamus tinctorius}, L.), but
this plant does not have a poisonous root.} 
%
%        \item \plant{luffa}{gargaraka $\rightarrow$ garāgarī?}{Luffa echinata,

%    rakta-śikhā?}{Plumbago zeylanica (or rosea?), L.}{NK \#1966, 
%    1967}
\footnote{The roots of both rose and white leadwort are very toxic.} 

\item \diff{\gls{anantā} (?)},\footnote{The text reads masculine
    \emph{ananta}, which is not a plant name.  Gayī's commentary on
    \Su{5.2.5}{564} noted a variant reading of feminine \emph{anantā} in
    place of \emph{gargaraka}, earlier in the compound. But the feminine
    \emph{anantā}, \gls{anantā}, is not a poisonous plant.} and

\item \gls{vijayā2},\footnote{\citet[61, n.\,3]{meul-sear} argued that our text
    reads a masculine or neuter noun \emph{vijaya}, which never signifies cannabis.
    However, unlike the vulgate, the unanimous readings of the Nepalese manuscripts
    give feminine \emph{vijayā}.  Nevertheless, even the feminine form only started to
    signify \emph{Cannabis sativa} L. after the end of the first millennium
    \citep{meul-sear,wuja-cann,mchu-2021}. The \emph{Sauśrutanighaṇṭu} gives 
    a 
    number
    of synonyms for \emph{vijayā}, almost none of which have any poisonous parts
    \citep[5.77, 10.143]{suve-2000}.  But one of them, \emph{viṣāṇī} (also
    \emph{meṣaśṛṅgī}), is sometimes equated with \emph{Dolichandrone falcata (DC.)
    Seemann} \citep[518]{adps}, a plant used as an abortifacient and fish poison
    \citep[\#862]{NK}.  This identification is tenuous.}

        \emph{kāla\-kūṭa} poison, here translated as `jequirity', is similar to
        `\emph{kāka\-cañcu}' or `Crow's Beak', which is indeed a name for the

        Nutgrass is tuberous, but non-toxic. Atis has highly toxic tuberous
        roots. Neither sacred lotus nor galls are toxic. The `alas, alas' poison
        (\emph{hālāhala}) is the mythical poison produced from the churning of
        the ocean at the time of creation: it occurs in medical texts such as
        the present one, and commentators identify it with one or other of the
        lethal poisons such as wolfsbane or jequirity.
        \citet[126]{agra-indi} makes the intriguing suggestion
        that the word \emph{hālāhala},
        possibly to be identified with Pāṇini's \emph{hailihila} (P.6.2.38),
        may be of Semitic origin, although his evidence
        seems uncertain (\citet[1506a]{stei-pers} cites Persian \emph{halāhil}
        `deadly (poison)' as a loan from Sanskrit). \cite[iii.585]{mayr-kurz}
        also cites a claim for an Austro-Asiatic origin for the word.}

    Thus, there are fifty-five stationary poisons.
    
    \item[6] There are believed to be four kinds of wolfsbane, two kinds of
\emph{mustaka}, and six kinds of Indian \emph{sarṣapa}.  But the rest are said
to be unique types.
    
    
    
    \subsection{The effects of poisons}
    \item[7--10]
    
People should know that root-poisons cause \se{udveṣṭana}{writhing}, 
\se{pralāpa}{ranting}, and
\se{moha}{delirium}, and  leaf-poisons cause yawning, writhing, and 
\se{śvāsa}{wheezing}.
    
 Fruit-poisons cause swelling of the
   scrotum, a burning feeling and writhing.  Flower-poisons will
    cause vomiting, \se{ādhmāna}{distension} and \se{svāpa}{sleep}.  
    
The consumption of poisons from bark, \se{sāra}{pith} and \se{niryāsa}{resin} 
will
cause foul breath, \se{pāruṣya}{hoarseness}, a headache, and a
discharge of \se{kapha}{phlegm}.\footnote{At \Su{1.2.6 }{11}, Ḍalhaṇa
glosses \se{pāruṣya}{hoarseness} as \emph{vāgrūkṣatā}, “a rough, 
dry voice.”}
    
    % 10
    
     The \se{kṣīra}{milky sap}-poisons make one froth at the mouth,  cause loose
stool, and make the tongue feel heavy.\footnote{At \Su{6.54.10}{773}, Ḍalhaṇa
glosses \se{viḍbheda}{loose stool} as \emph{dravapurīṣatā}, “having liquid
stool.” }  The \se{dhātu}{element}-poisons give one a crushing pain in the
chest, make one faint and cause a burning feeling on the palate.
    
    % 11
    These poisons

    \item[ 20b]
    Because of dryness, it may cause inflammation of the wind; because of heat
    it inflames the choler and blood. 
    %21
    Because of the sharpness it unhinges the
    mind, and it cuts through the connections with the \skt{sensitive
        points}{marman}.  Because it is rarified it can infiltrate and distort
    the parts of the body.\footnote{We read the active \emph{vikaroti} with 
    Ḍalhaṇa against the 
    transmitted passive \emph{vikriyeta}, since it must be the parts of the body 
    that are distorted, not the poison.}    
    

\item[22]
Because it is fast-acting it kills quickly, and because of its pervasiveness
it affects one's \skt{whole physical constitution}{prakṛti}.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa
on \Su{5.2.22}{565} explained this as “\se{akhiladehavyāptirūpam}{takes the
form of pervading the whole body}.”}  Because of its expansiveness it enters
into the \se{doṣa}{humour}s, \se{dhātu}{bodily constiuents}s, and even the
impurities\sskt{impurity}{mala}.  Because it is limpid it overflows, and
because it is light it is difficult to treat.  Because it is indigestible it
is hard to eliminate.  Therefore, it causes suffering for a long time.
    
    \item[ 24]
    Any poison that is instantly lethal, whether it be
    stationary, mobile, or artificial, will be known to 
    have all ten of these qualities.

        which has just lost its qualities by itself,\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa specified that this 
        refers to the ten 
        qualities that are mentioned above (\Su{5.2.26}{565}).} becomes a

        \Su{1.46.83}{222} while explaining \emph{dūṣīviṣa}.}
                Because it has lost its potency it is
        no longer perceived.  Because it is surrounded by \se{kapha}{phlegm} it 
        has an aftermath that lasts for a very long time.
        
        \item[27] If he is suffering from this, the colour of his stools changes,
he gets sourness and a bad taste with great thirst. Stammering and close
to death, wandering about, he may feel faint, giddy, and
aroused.\footnote{Similar symptoms of slow-acting poison are described at
\Su{2.7.11--13}{296} in the context of  \se{duṣyodara}{contamination

%        gain power over him (2.7.11--13).}



        \item[28]
        If it lodges in his \se{āmāśaya}{stomach}, he becomes sick because of wind 
        and phlegm; if it lodges in his \se{pakvāśaya}{intestines}, he becomes sick 
        because of  wind and

        \item[29a--c]
        If it lodges in one of the body tissues such as 
        \se{rasa}{chyle}, it causes the diseases arising
        from the body tissues, that have been said to be wrong.\footnote{The 
        expression \emph{ayathāyathoktān} “stated to be unsuitable” is hard to 
        understand here, but is clearly transmitted in the Nepalese version.}

    limbs}.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa \Su{5.2.30ab}{565} glossed “disjunction” as the
loss of function of the joints in regard to movement.} Next, it causes
\se{annamada}{intoxication from food} and indigestion, \se{arocaka}{loss
    of appetite}, the condition of having a \se{koṭha}{skin disease} with

    different, recommending that the patient have medicated powder blown up
    his nose. It may be possible to detect the evolution of the Nepalese
    \dev{avasīdet} to the vulgate's \dev{avapīḍaś}.  The vulgate version is
    hard to construe, and we see Ḍalhaṇa struggling to interpret it in his

same is the case at \Su{5.5.24}{575} and the clear description at
\Su{5.5.45}{577}, in neither of which is the therapy supported in the

\se{kalka}{mash} of the following plants: %
\gls{madhuka},
\gls{tagara},
\gls{kuṣṭha},
\gls{bhadradāru},
\gls{hareṇu},
\diff{\gls{mañjiṣṭhā}},
\gls{elā}
and \gls{elavālu},
\gls{nāgapuṣpa},
\gls{utpala},
\gls{sitā},
\gls{viḍaṅga},
\gls{candana},
\gls{patra},
\gls{priyaṅgu},
\gls{dhyāmaka},
the two turmerics,\footnote{I.e., \gls{rajanī} and \gls{dāruharidrā}.}
the two Indian nightshades,\footnote{I.e., \gls{bṛhatī} and \gls{kṣudrā}.}
the two kinds of \gls{sārivā},\footnote{I.e., \gls{anantā} and \gls{pālindī}.}
\gls{aṃśumatī},

    \subsection{Curing the `slow-acting' poison}
    

\begin{translation}    
    
    \item[ 50--52]
    
        Someone suffering from “\se{dūṣīviṣa}{slow-acting poison}” should be well
        sweated, and purged both top and bottom.  Then he should be
        made to drink the following \diff{eminent} antidote which removes “slow-acting
        poison:”
    
    Take
    \gls{pippalī},
    \gls{dhyāmaka},
    \gls{māṃsī},
\diff{\gls{lodhra}, \gls{elā}},
\gls{suvarcikā},
\gls{bālaka}, 
\gls{gairika}, as well as \gls{hema},
and
\gls{paripelavā}.

This antitoxin, taken with honey, eliminates slow-acting poison. It is called the
“\se{dūṣīviṣāri}{enemy of slow-acting poison},” and it is not prohibited in other situations.
    
    % Deepro - 
    
    \item[ 53--54]
    If there are any other \se{upadrava}{side-effects}, such as fever, a burning
    feeling, hiccups, \se{ānāha}{constipation}, depletion of the semen,
    distension, diarrhoea, fainting, skin problems,
    \se{jaṭhara}{bellyache}, madness, trembling, then one
    should treat each one in its own terms,  using anti-toxic
    medicines.
    
    \item[ 55] For a prudent person, the slow-acting poison can be \se{sādhya}{cured}
immediately.  It is \se{yāpya}{treatable} if it is of a year's standing. Other
than this, it should be avoided for the person who eats unwholesome things.
